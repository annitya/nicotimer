Nicotimer 
=========
When your intake reaches 5mg or less, your physical dependence is over!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Count the number of nicotine-units you consume during a day.
A too high number is better than one too low. Remember; we want do this without any symptoms of withdrawal.

2. Enter the value from the previous step in the target-field.

3. Enter the number of nicotine-units you consume simultaneously in the unit-field.

4. Enter the current date (dd.mm.yyyy) in the start-date field.

5. Click "Start" when you have your first nicotine-unit of the day.

6. Your units will then be distributed evenly throughout the day.
You will get a push-notification when it's time. If you don't want nicotime when the push-message appears, 
expand the notification and click "reject". Swiping the notification away or clicking it implies you ingested a unit. 
If you reject a notification, the time between notifications will become slightly lower.
Less nicotine during a day is allowed, more should be avoided. Duh!

7. The app assumes that you sleep 7,5 hours each night. An average interval will be used should you stay up later.

8. Click "stop" before you go to sleep. Number of expected nicotine-unites will be adjusted after a formula created
with the sole purpose of keeping withdrawals to a minimum.

Todo
----
 
1. Better separation of concerns between TimerService and IntervalTimer.
2. Instructions too long => improve UX.
